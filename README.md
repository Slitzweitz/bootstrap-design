# bootstrap-design
# This is my first repository on github. It's all the files necessary for a 
# basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript(jQuery) website. 
# It uses jQuery and a plugin (Magnific Popup, available @ http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/)
# to show embedded GitHub examples of HTML, CSS, and JS.
